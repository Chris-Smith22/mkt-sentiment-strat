      "The company has crossed the chasm into the early majority. They are decreasing the cars costs and therefore margins for the most part without an increase in volume greater than their price decreases. They keep playing pricing games destroying the value for current car owners making repeat customer less likely (most car owners repeatedly buy a brand). Their FSD is overpriced considering the TACC operates in much the same way. They could decrease fsd subscription costs (which they did) to increase the revenue on a product with no marginal cost (once coded, it doesn’t cost them more to sell 1 or 1000 subscriptions) but who is going to pay for the fsd when it doesn’t work much better than TACC after all the bad press. On top of all this, the guy running a unicorn wants more equity to “continue innovating” in fields like AI. None of this is good for investors BUT when we trade it’s a secondary market. We buy shares from others not from Tesla. If Tesla thinks they will turn things around they would buy back shares on the open market and gain the benefit when it rises but I don’t see it happening- so that is an indicator. I haven’t run a price target, I’m sure there is reports online doing it, but I’d say between 100-150 is a reasonable expectation for their current performance.\n",

The tsla supporters could wag the dog. so I think 150-155 is roughly the highest it will be from this point forward. I am sticking to my guess of 25-35 P/E. Wall Street currently expects Tesla earnings per share of $2.70 in 2024 - so doing the math with the range puts it upper end around 100, lower end maybe 70.

I do not recommend trading earnings, trade on the lead up to earnings, or afterwards.  My next target is 152.16, then go from there.  152 is a strong support level (See April 26, 2023).
